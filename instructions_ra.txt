The samplelist.txt is what you give it as the $SAMPLELIST argument, it's supposed to be a list of base sample names. The script then assumes that your filtered files are named ${SAMPLE}_1.filtered.fq.gz/${SAMPLE}_2.filtered.fq.gz 

So, for example, if my reads are called LK_Cm1_1.filtered.fq.gz and LK_Cm1_2.filtered.fq.gz, then the sample name on the sample list should be LK_Cm1

If your reads are named differently (like LK_Cm1.R1.fq.gz) then you need to change the path accordingly in the script, before it passes it to the job


For the repeat annotation stuff, here is the instruction page from our github: https://github.com/LIB-insect-comparative-genomics/bigfoot/blob/main/RA_installation.md

In the EarlGrey installation part at the very end, you don't need to change the scripts anymore, since the software has been updated
There's also some changes in the RepeatModeler configuration steps, I will look through them tomorrow and send you an updated version

> Lisa:
📎 configure_dfam39.sh

> Fran:
ok. this is regarding the instalation of RepeatMasker?

> Lisa:
It's about configuring the RepeatMasker that gets installed when you install EarlGrey via conda
You can run the EarlGrey and other repeat tools (so repeats 01-03) in parallel, then once they're all finished you can run the fourth script to merge them together into one bed file

> Lisa:
If Eckart has run all the repeat annotation steps but not the merge one (check if there's a ....repetitive.bed.gz file in the directory), then you have to run the merge script. It can be a bit tricky, because the paths to the individual files are hard-coded in the script, so you might have to change it a little bit

> Lisa:
Next steps would be to run a SNP call/SNP filter/merge the by-region VCFs, if you haven't done this already, and then use the ...repetitive.bed.gz file to filter out the repetitive regions from your VCF file

Hi Fran! I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to send this to you yesterday!
The variables you pass to it should be: SPECIES=Genus.species OUTPUTDIR=/full/path/to/outputdir REF=/full/path/to/referencegenome.fa VCF=/full/path/to/vcf.missingdatafilter PHASINGDIR=/full/path/to/phasingdir (where you want it to put the phased vcf)
